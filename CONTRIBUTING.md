Contributing
============

First of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!

Here are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews, and discussions before
maintainers accept and merge your work.

You MUST follow some coding standard rules, like [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/)
and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/). Fortunately, you can automate the fixing
for that rules, using [PHP-CS-Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) tool.
There is a configuration file included in this repository, named `.php_cs`.

You MUST run the test suite.

You MUST write (or update) unit tests.

Please, write [commit messages that make
sense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),
and [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)
before submitting your Pull Request.

Thank you!
